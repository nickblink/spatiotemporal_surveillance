# spatiotemporal_surveillance

This is the repository for the paper "Spatio-Temporal Methods to Handle Missing Data in Syndromic Surveillance with Applications to Health Management Information System Data". 

The code used to conduct the simulations and get the results for the paper are kept here.

An example run through of the code is conducted in /code/main.R. This demonstrates how to generate data and fit the models. To run the full simulations done in this study requires high performance computing and is not included in this github.
